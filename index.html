<h2 id="hafestranfolksong">Hafestran Folk Song</h2>
<p>
  Someday I will see you again, I will<br />
  Climb the mountains longing for it.<br />
  I will have your embrace even as I climb so far to see the world.<br/>
  I will climb so far.<br/>
  I climb the world, as it is my will.
</p>

<h2 id="selfdoubt">Self Doubt</h2>
<p>
  Slowly the mind eats itself.<br />
  Even as the thoughts melt away<br />
  Low key night terrors<br />
  Follow along the way.<br />
  Deny the pain, deny the dullness<br />
  Of the doubt there to stay.<br />
  Unless one prefers no company<br />
  Besides the shadows on the wall<br />
  There to stay.
</p>

<h2 id="ravenrose">Raven Rose</h2>
<p>
  The rose in her<br />
  Hair; the flowing, flowing<br />
  Dress, eyes forlorn.<br />
  Across the sand and rivers,<br />
  Across the sand and rivers.<br />
  The long black hair<br />
  Flowing; her eyes forlorn<br />
  For the old raven<br />
  That said nevermore.<br />
  Rose in hair.
</p>

<h2 id="seguidilladiishamisen">Seguidilla Dii Shamisen</h2>
<p>
  Between hills and forests<br />
  Under blown leaf<br />
  The wolf hunts a black sheep<br />
  Under blown leaf.<br />
  Between hills and forests<br />
  The shadows glare.<br />
  Beneath the damp leaf.<br /><br />

  Mignon girl running<br />
  To catch a deer blitzing.<br />
  The daffodil flops,<br />
  As the day comes closing.<br />
  As the day comes closing,<br />
  The moonlight is<br />
  Hovering; cloudy sky<br />
  Pouring with the<br />
  Rain falling from the sky.<br />
  Only tears end this day.<br /><br />

  The wolf now is so hungry<br />
  For the dark brown dress.<br />
  The wolf now is so hungry<br />
  For a long caress.<br />
  The wolf now is so hungry<br />
  For the blood on dress<br />
  From Daffodil's blood.
</p>

<h2 id="anthemadiihafestra">Anthema Dii Hafestra</h2>
<p>
  All the old women<br />
  Carrying the hunger pains.<br />
  All the old men<br />
  Working the night shift.<br />
  Carrying the hunger pains,<br />
  We want liberty.<br />
  Carrying the hunger pains,<br />
  Working the night shift.<br />
  Along the bright city lights.<br />
  Along the bright city lights.<br />
  How proud we be<br />
  To be of the shining knights,<br />
  With pitchforks and sledge.

  Arise, fatherland's children,<br />
  May your rein last 1000 years.<br />
  Arise, fatherland's children,<br />
  Become like boulders,<br />
  Grow into a battalion.<br />
  Arm our citizens.<br /><br />

  The blades so sharp<br />
  And true to a point.<br />
  Uniforms so sleak.<br />
  The nighthawk reins highlands.<br />
  The nighthawk reins highlands.<br />
  From the sky it drops<br />
  To eat fallen depris.<br />
  From the sky it drops<br />
  All the dust from the dark sky.<br />
  All the dust from the dark sky.<br /><br />

  Arise, fatherland's children,<br />

  Arise, fatherland's children,<br />

<h2 id="fromglasstograss">From Glass To Grass</h2>
<p>
  During the cold Spring rain,<br />
  The drops of blue on grass.<br />
  All that is profane<br />
  Shall all turn into glass.<br />
  Of all the ways to fall down,<br />
  The glass shall revert to grass.<br /><br />

  In all many pieces<br />
  That have returned to<br />
  glass, the many pieces,<br />
  All that is profane,<br />
  Shall all turn into glass.<br /><br />

  Of all the ways to fall down,<br />
  The glass shall revert to the grass.
</p>

<h2 id="midnightsunset">Midnight Sunset</h2>
<p>
  I seek the cold  water, down river<br />
  flowing.<br />
  For all those lights<br />
  In the city nights<br />
  glowing.<br />
  To clear thoughts<br />
  For all misery<br />
  growing.<br /><br />

  For me I wither<br />
  In your so gentle arms<br />
  In your embrace.<br />
  I now seek that embrace.<br />
  I now seek that embrace.<br />
  So small I feel<br />
  And yet, embrace<br />
  The flow around my neck<br />
  And down my spine.<br />
  For you my divine.<br />
  For you my divine.<br /><br />

  To think I am but a<br />
  Small thing, yet I trust it<br />
  That you love<br />
  Under midnight sunset.<br />
  Under midnight sunset.<br />
</p>

<h2 id="konnichiwalebezefleurs">Konnichiwa Le Beze Fleurs</h2>
<p>
  Arigato pour le sabots de bois.<br />
  Arigato pour le fleurs.<br />
  Mais non pour le beze.<br />
  Ou le cheval rein le soliel!<br />
  Pour le cheval es cheval noir.<br /><br />

  Arigato pour le sabots de bois,<br />
  Mais non pour mon chevel de mort.<br />
  Konnichiwa un chevel de vie.<br /><br />

  Konnichiwa pour beze de fleurs.<br />
  Konnichiwa pour beze de fleurs.
</p>

<h2 id="disillussionmusicbox">Disillussion Music Box</h2>
<p>
  Dying inside, within<br />
  Inside the mind I rest.<br />
  Slowly under skin<br />
  Inside I rot long within.<br />
  Long days ahead in mind<br />
  Lasting seasons.<br /><br />

  Under a thinning roof<br />
  Slowly I must go poof.<br />
  Inside mind, rest<br />
  On the old futon.<br />
  Nocturnal moonlight for<br />
  So many seasons.<br /><br />

  For I am exhausted,<br />
  In my dillussionment.
</p>

<h2 id="districtofswords">District Of Swords</h2>
<p>
  For the anthem that<br />
  decorates the room<br />
  In blue and red,<br />
  A petite brunnette<br />
  Loses her very head.<br /><br />

  In other districts<br />
  Where one shall die,<br />
  They hang or fry<br />
  In that dimly lit district<br />
  That one may live to try.<br /><br />

  For Marxist dreams<br />
  The old reality screams<br />
  Wanting katharsis.<br />
  Reality anguishes,<br />
  Love now languishes.<br /><br />

  For unlike my<br />
  Dreams of love afar<br />
  Across the sea<br />
  Reality not free<br />
  Wants one not to bleed.<br /><br />

  For the anthem that<br />
  decorates the room<br />
  In blue and red,<br />
  A petite brunnette<br />
  Loses her very head.<br /><br />

  Whether its gallows<br />
  Or a Soviet cartridge<br />
  Across the winter hallows,<br />
  Or a guillotine.<br />
  Or a guillotine.<br /><br />

  One can only dream,<br />
  Of a better world,<br />
  where one shall not bleed.
</p>

<h2 id="mytatania">My Tatania</h2>
<p>
  Her name inspires<br />
  Soul, in fire<br />
  Yelling.<br />
  Tatania, from her lips<br />
  Down to her very big hips.<br />
  In her birkenstock clogs<br />
  She sways those hips<br />
  As if it werent<br />
  Trippy.<br />
       That half one thing girl,<br />
       And half another,<br />
       From Montrael.<br />
</p>

<h2 id="untilmidnightcomes">Until Midnight Comes</h2>
<p>
  From sea to rivers<br />
  The clouds now forming<br />
  Collect around<br />
  The tree, dust storming<br />
  Until midnight comes.<br /><br />

  It is midnight that<br />
  I dread the most<br />
  Hiding<br />
  Under the covers<br />
  From the shadow men<br />
  Lurking.<br />
  With those long scowls,<br />
  And snaggly teeth<br />
  Chomping.<br /><br />

  But by day it fades<br />
  Now Fading fadingly<br />
  From the old walls<br />
  Cracked with old age<br />
  Waiting in the sun.<br />
</p>

<h2 id="sandfennics">Sand Fennics</h2>
<p>
  To think that I see gold<br />
  Where there is only dust.<br />
  In this world of rust.<br />
  The dust so strong and windy<br />
  Across the midnight evening.<br /><br />

  I wander the sand.<br />
  I seek and demand<br />
  Water.<br />
  Through the hot sand<br />
  I cover my hat<br />
  Tilting.<br />
  And beyond dunes<br />
  With land runes<br />
  Hiding...<br /><br />

  The wild sand fennics<br />
  Scrounge for the bugs<br />
  Crawling in the sand.<br />
  Hungry, they seek bugs<br />
  For all of life.
</p>

<h2 id="flamencoderenga">Flameno De Renga</h2>
<p>
  For my rose of black<br />
  In that fine dress of black<br />
  Flowing in the wind.<br /><br />

  Our necks embrace,<br />
  Connecting the face.<br />

  For in this we hold<br />
  Some vague story<br />
  Yet to be so told.<br /><br />

  For you it is distant<br />
  Memories gone by.<br /><br />

  For my rose of black<br />
  In that fine dress of black<br />
  Flowing in the wind.<br /><br />

  I have to think of<br />
  A reason to stay.
</p>

<h2 id="lobsterboil">Lobster Boil</h2>
<p>
  Water boiling
  In the pot now steaming.
  High pitch is loud.

  From blue to dark red.
  From blue to dark red.

  Lobster steaming
  In the old misty kitchen
  Until meat red.

  From blue to dark red.
  From blue to dark red.
</p>

<h2 id="seekingonlylips">Seeking Only Lips</h2>
<p>
  You know they<br />
  Have it now for you<br />
  When they test the words.<br /><br />

  For they seek only words.<br />
  For they seek only words.<br /><br />

  To think they try<br />
  And see it all through<br />
  From mouth to lips.<br /><br />

  They seek lips as the tips.<br />
  They seek lips as the tips.
</p>

<h2 id="thecatisblack">The Cat Is Black</h2>
<p>
  Le chatte c'est noir.<br />
  The black cat climbing<br />
  An old wooden fence,<br />
  The moonlight is<br />
  Shining high in the<br />
  Sky. All that wild frizz.<br />

  Le chatte c'est noir.<br />
  Le chatte c'est noir.<br />

  Arigato pour le poisson.<br />
  Je pense des poisson gozaimase.<br />
  Gozaimase arigato pour le poisson.<br />
  Gozaimase pour le wasabi.<br />
  Le chatte c'est noir<br />
  Et manger des wasabi.<br />
</p>

<h2 id="midnightshadowtree">Midnight Shadow Tree</h2>
<p>
  I ride a horse<br />
  into the falling sunset.<br />
  Midnight is coming.<br /><br />

  I ride a black horse<br />
  With my rifle in tow,<br />
  A girl with a bow<br />
  lopsided, also sits<br />
  behind me, holding on<br />
  As the bow slides off.<br /><br />

  As shadows lurking<br />
  In the dark midnight forest,<br />
  The wolves now howl.<br /><br />

  The wolf with its baying<br />
  Now seeks comfort<br />
  Under a burned tree,<br />
  Swaying slowly in<br />
  The gently blowing<br />
  wind. Morning comes knocking<br />
  Under the burned tree.<br /><br />

  As shadows lurking<br />
  In the dark midnight forest,<br />
  The wolves howled.<br /><br />

  The shadows now fade away.<br />
  The shadows burn away,<br />
  Under a morning sun.
</p>

<h2 id="emelie">Emelie</h2>
<p>
  It could be her locks.<br />
  Wavy, blond, and falling.<br />
  Or her birkenstocks.<br />
  With cat eye glasses,<br />
  I embrace those locks.<br /><br />

  It was not this that burnt<br />
  the only desires<br />
  I had to be with<br />
  her, till dying day.<br />
  I would not care<br /><br />

  If I never had my way.<br />
  It took one conversation,<br />
  About types, from second hand<br />
  To tell me not just<br /><br />

  That I would never have her hand,<br />
  But nobody else.<br />
  She had her chance,<br />
  As I could have had mine.<br /><br />

  But now I give in,<br />
  And find synthetic dolls<br />
  So divine.
</p>

<h3 id="roommates">Room Mates</h3>
<p>
  You think you have it.<br />
  That great fashion sense.<br />
  But you're my grandma<br />
  crawling in old girl's dress.<br />
  I suppose some have no sense<br />
  but to crawl the world in a flower cap shuffling.<br />
  You're my grandma in a tattered dress.
</p>

<h3 id="wandertheearth">Wander The Earth</h3>
<p>
  The quietness<br />
  In the cold morning air.<br />
  Shadows now looming.<br /><br />

  In the shadows I wander.<br />
  In the shadows I wander.<br /><br />

  No sound now stirs<br />
  In the cold morning air.<br />
  Shadows now looming,<br /><br />

  As I wander the Earth.<br />
  As I wander the Earth.

<h3 id="animalsbythetorii">Animals By The Torii</h3>

  In the cold rain / with the coldest wind<br />
  The Shinto temple shining / and Mother Mary crying.<br />
  The moonlight glows / in land of Winter.<br />
  The mountains loom / and flowers bloom.<br />
  The mountains loom / and flowers bloom.<br />
  In this song I sing / in time passing<br />
  The wolf in the pack / and the bear fishing<br />
  Seek refreshment / seek the water.<br />
  The Torii looming / in the dark forest green.<br />
  The Torii looming / in the dark forest green.

  On a horse, on a horse.<br />

  Those eyes glow.<br />

  Missing their lover afar.<br />
  Out the window into night,<br />

<p>
  Sounds of city streets blaring,<br />
  The trains blending in with the old wind chimes.<br />
  The raindrops pouring down splatter down the drain, downward.<br />
  Come sound of rain, give me your chilling rhymes.<br /><br />

  On this lute I strum<br />
  A flowing flowing hum.<br />
  The wind is chilling<br />
  The wrinkled leather drum.<br />
  On this lute I strum.<br /><br />

  Strumming, strumming to the...<br /><br />

  Sounds of city streets blaring,<br />

  The raindrops pouring down splatter down the drain, downward.<br />
  Come sound of rain, give me your chilling rhymes.

<p>
  She asked for a hot omulet,<br />
  But I only had rice with my water<br />
  To mix the flour as if it were with eggs and cheese.<br />
  For our old bread is their omulets.<br /><br />

  When their army came and went,<br />
  Left behind was rice with water.<br />
  In the civil wars so long ago it was black eyed peas.<br />
  Left behind was rice with water.<br /><br />

  Despite our lack of food,<br />
  We worked the soil no more on that day.<br />
  So many years ago in that soil we drove them off.<br />
  We worked the soil no more on that day.<br /><br />

  Though left behind was the rice,<br />
  To have any food at all in that time<br />
  Was very nice, very very very nice on that day.<br />
  Left behind was rice with water.<br /><br />

  But despite it all, we were OK.<br />
  But despite it all, we were OK.

<h3 id="hairwithrosenoir">Hair With Rose Noir</h3>
<p>
  She wore a long flowing black dress,<br />
  As she walked up the scaffold stairs climbing.<br />
  And in her curly black hair there was a rose noir,<br />
  As she walked up the scaffold stairs climbing.<br /><br />

  Upon the lunette she stood,<br />
  Upon that lunette she was so eternally descending<br />
  Into the stocks for her beheading that she long awaits.<br />
  Upon that lunette she was so eternally descending.<br /><br />

  On her dying day her head went.<br />
  Down came the rose in her hair, it falls.

<h3 id="windinthecatacombs">Wind In The Catacombs</h3>
<p>
  To think I see wind,<br />
  In these catacombs deep.<br />
  In these catacombs I choose to tonight sleep.<br />
  In these catacombs deep.<br /><br />

  I wait for the monsters within,<br />
  As they come a wanting for my tiny neck.<br />
  To see all my hair come down falling on the floor.<br />
  Now they come a wanting for my tiny neck.<br /><br />

  To think I see wind,<br />
  In these catacombs deep.<br />
  In these catacombs I choose to tonight sleep.<br />
  In these catacombs deep.<br /><br />

  Those beasts within bite down,<br />
  Lusting after my tiny neck.

  I hold up that flag,<br />
  Despite so many flaws.<br />
  I hold up that flag<br />

<h3 id="sittinginatree">Sitting In A Tree</h3>
<p>
  Before night time I'm sitting,<br />
  Sitting in the tree.<br />
  Sitting in the tree,<br />

  Before night time I'm sitting<br />
  Watching the midnight sky falling down.<br /><br />

  From deserts to the rain forests<br />
  I see the world.<br />
  I see the world<br />
  Along the trees.<br />
  From deserts to the rain forests<br />

  Watching the midnight sky falling down,<br />
  I see the world along the tall trees.<br />

<h3 id="hillsidesundersunset">Hillsides Under Sunset</h3>
<p>
  The hillsides under sunset<br />
  Glow in the sunlight till moonlight comes.<br />
  In the hillside under sunset<br />
  The trees sway back<br />
  And forth in the wind, till moonlight.<br />
  The hillsides under sunset.<br /><br />

  Under dark moonlight skies<br />
  The owls of the forest hide in trees.<br />
  Under the dark moonlight skies.<br />
  They seek food and water.<br />
  For water and food they want.<br />
  They seek food and water.<br /><br />

  The tower in the distance<br />
  Calls the wind and the water at day.<br />
  The old tower in the distance<br />
  Seeks the quiet warm day.<br />
  As the day becomes colder,<br />
  The city becomes a ghost town.<br /><br />

  The city becomes a ghost town,<br />
  And no voice is stirring.

  She dangled down the chimney.<br />
  With her white dress,<br />
  She dangled on noose.<br />
  She dangled on noose.<br />
  The cold season<br />
  brings chocolate<br />
  Treats, and presents<br />
  Through the whole year.<br />
  Through the whole year.<br /><br />

  The Chistmas Vampire hung<br />
  On London bridge, and left<br />
  Two children. Paupers<br />
  Without a seasons bring.<br />
  The Christmas Vampire hung,<br />
  On London bridge.<br /><br />

  One became a banker,<br />
  The other a CEO.<br />
  The eldest was a wanker,<br />
  While the other watched space movies,<br />
  On an old terminal,<br /><br />

  And thumb their noses at paupers,<br />
  Without a seasons bring.

<h3 id="thebaguettearmy">The Baguette Army</h3>
<p>
  They came for the<br />
  women and children in storm,<br />
  Marching on road.<br />
  The unit then rolled forth.<br />
  The unit then rolled forth.<br /><br />

  Down the old chimney<br />
  Was the smokes in the lungs<br />
  Blowing in the wind.<br />
  The unit came rolling.<br />
  The unit came rolling.<br /><br />

  Down the old highway<br >
  They came rolling along<br />
  Marching on road.<br /><br />

  The bombs and the war dogs<br />
  Came rolling along.

<h3 id="thecityrats">The City Rats</h3>
<p>
  The city music
  Is calling for me.
  The city music
  Of the rats.

  Closing dark city streets.
  The windows cracked.
  The rats scurry about.
  The weather is sleet
  As the golf balls whack.
  The rats scurry about.

  The city music
  Of the city rats.

<h3 id="thedeaddorise">The Dead Do Rise</h3>
<p>
  The sword sharp shines<br />
  in the river brine<br />
  that is divine,<br />
  In the darkest water fall.<br />
  its blade shines so bright,<br />
  Its blade shines so bright.<br /><br />

  In this cold Winter<br />
  where the souls rise<br />
  The dead rocking<br />
  Out of their caskets.<br />
  Out of their caskets.<br /><br />

  It seeks holder<br />
  who may be so much bolder,<br />
  yet is much colder<br />
  than any slimey merchant fox.<br />
  Slicing the leaf.<br />
  Slicing the leaf.<br /><br />

  In this cold Winter<br />
  where the souls rise,<br />
  the dead rocking<br />
  Out of their caskets,<br />
  Out of their caskets<br /><br />

  The dead do rise.<br />
  The dead do rise.
